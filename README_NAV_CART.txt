NAV + CART LINK — QUICK SETUP

This bundle gives you a single script that guarantees a visible header with a Cart link on ANY page.

FILES
- assets/nav-cart.js

INSTALL (do once per page)
1) Upload assets/nav-cart.js to your repo.
2) On each HTML page (index.html, shop.html, gallery/index.html, clients/index.html, about.html, contact.html, checkout.html, cart.html, etc.),
   add this line just before </body>:
   <script src="assets/nav-cart.js" defer></script>

WHAT IT DOES
- If your page already has a header/nav, it keeps it and adds a "Cart" link (to /cart.html).
- If the page has no nav, it creates a clean, styled header with common links (Home, Shop, Gallery, Client Portals, About, Contact, Cart).
- Includes a small floating Cart button on mobile so it’s always reachable.

GITHUB PAGES BASE PATH
- Works automatically on joshccrump.github.io/custom-clothing-site/ by detecting the base path.
